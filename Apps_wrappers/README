XMMS and Xine App Wrappers
---------------------------

Copy xmms.app and xine.app to an Apps directory 
(e.g. GNUstep/Local/Apps).

NOTE: The Workspace will prefer xine.app also for mp3 files and such 
because of the alphabetical order. So, you might want to set XMMS as
default by  selecting a mp3 file in GWorkspace, opening the Tools 
Inspector, clicking the XMMS icon and then clicking "Set Default".
